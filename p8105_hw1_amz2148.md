# Problem 1

First we load the `penguins` dataset.

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) #shows all code chunks
library(tidyverse) #loads tidyverse package
```

``` r
library(plyr) #loads plyr package
```

    ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ## You have loaded plyr after dplyr - this is likely to cause problems.
    ## If you need functions from both plyr and dplyr, please load plyr first, then dplyr:
    ## library(plyr); library(dplyr)

    ## Attaching package: 'plyr'
    ## 
    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':
    ## 
    ##     arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise,

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") #loads dataset
```

In the `penguins` dataset, the names of key variables are
`species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year`.
As indicated by the `summary(penguins)` function run below, in this
dataset there are 3 categories of species: `Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo`
with `152, 68, 124` penguins each respectively; there are 3 categories
of island: `Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen` with `168, 124, 52` penguins
respectively; and there are 2 categories of sex: `female, male, NA` with
`165, 168, 11` penguins respectively. Mean bill length is `43.92`mm,
mean bill depth is `17.15`mm, mean flipper length is `200.9`mm, and mean
body mass is `4202`g. Years range from `2007` to `2009`, with a mean
year of `2008`. The dataset has `344` rows (observations) and `8`
columns (variables).

``` r
summary(penguins) #provides summary of variable names and values
```

Below is a scatterplot of flipper length in mm (y) vs. bill length in mm
(x), with observations colorcoded by species. This scatterplot is
created using the `ggplot()` function through the `tidyverse` package.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm,col=species)) + geom_point() #creates colorcoded scatterplot
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Finally, we set the working directory and export the scatterplot above.

``` r
setwd("~/Documents/Columbia University/Fall 2022/Data Science/Homeworks/Homework1/p8105_hw1_amz2148") #set working directory
ggsave("p8105_hw1p1_amz2148.pdf", height = 4, width = 6) #export scatterplot
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

# Problem 2

First we create a data frame with various specifications:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  random_norm = rnorm(10),
  random_pos = random_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("small", "small", "small", "medium", "medium", "medium", "large", "large", "large", "small"))
)
```

When attempting to take the mean of these variables using the `pull` and
`mean` functions, only the random sample and logical variables result in
numeric means (these two are seen below). The other two variables are
not numeric and therefore means cannot be calculated.

The mean of the `random_norm` variable is `-0.1649613`. The mean of the
`random_pos` logical variable is `0.3`.

Below is a code chunk that applies the `as.numeric` function to the
logical, character, and factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(p2_df$random_pos)
as.numeric(p2_df$vec_char)
as.numeric(p2_df$vec_factor)
```

When running this code, the logical and factor variables can be treated
as numeric variables, which allow one to calculate a mean. But the
character variable cannot be treated as a numeric variable, which
explains why a mean can still not be calculated even with the
`as.numeric` function.
